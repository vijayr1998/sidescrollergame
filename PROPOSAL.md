# Project Proposal
## What the Project is about

I would like to create a side-scroller platformer where my character sprite has to jump onto obstacles and platforms to advance, and has to jump over (static) enemies.
## My inspiration

I have been a Nintendo fan for years, having played Mario and Donkey Kong for the better part of my life. My first Nintendo DS game was New Super Mario Bros. in 2006, and that was such a great game despite being so simple. Thus, I would like to do something similar for my final project.

## Libraries

This is the difficult part. I think I would need a game engine, so I would like to use something simple and 2D like Cocos2d-x or Oxygine. This would allow me to move the character front and back, keep track of scores and health, etc. I would also like to use the SFML Library for audio support and other graphics. 

## Challenges

Getting started early on and learning how to use the libraries efficiently and with the least amount of bugs. I also need to figure out how to "side-scroll" and maybe even create enemies that will move. 

## How the Game Will Work

There will be a player sprite on the screen with UI elements and background elements (maybe a cloud, a bush, etc). The player will have to use WASD to move (just like snake) and avoid enemies and other obstacles. The player has to avoid holes in the ground, otherwise they will "die" (controlled by a boolean like snake does) and will lose a life. The challenge will be to deicde how a level has ended and to load a new level. 

If this is too hard, I will just have one level scrolling to infinity and let the player start where they died until they are out of lives to play. 

## Steps

1. Finalize the libraries I will use. 
2. Learn about all the functions I can use.
3. Learn how to include everything in a single OF project.
4. Have little parts working at a time so I have something to commit.
5. Figure out how testing these methods would happen.
6. Have fun!
