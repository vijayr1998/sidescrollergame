#  A running log of my progress 

## Progress so far 

1. Learning how to use the cocos2d-x library to build a simple side scrolling game. 
2. I have learned how to use sprites, images that will be my main character. 
3. I have learned about scenes, which are distinct parts of my game. 
4. I have learned about actions, which I will use to simulate enemies. 
5. I have learned how to update in the background. 

## What I have to do

1. I still have to learn how to build levels, how to progress through a level, or how to use infinite scroll. 
2. I have to learn how to use gravity.
3. I have to learn how to do collisions to kill enemies. If no time, I will only code collecting items.
4. I have to decide how to implement my player character, and whether I can have different sprites for jump, crouch, and lateral movement.
